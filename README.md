Markdown# 🚀 Daily Coding & Problem Solving Journey
*Consistency is the key to mastery.*

Hi, I'm **Vishal Yadav**! 👋 Welcome to my personal repository where I document my daily progress in Data Structures, Algorithms, and coding practice.

## 🎯 About This Repository
This isn't just a code dump. For every problem I solve, I focus on:
- **Clean Code:** Writing optimized and readable solutions in **Python** and **Java**.
- **Visual Learning:** Including my hand-written/copy-pen **Dry Runs** to explain *how* the algorithm works step-by-step.
- **Complexity Analysis:** Always tracking Time and Space complexities.

## 📂 Repository Structure
I use a custom Python automation script to maintain a clean, standardized structure:
